# Webpack-React-Babel

A boilerplate for a Webpack bundled React project with Babel.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
a node package manager (yarn or npm)
a command line terminal (iTerm or bash)
your favorite IDE (vscode, sublime)
```

### Installing

In order to clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RickBr0wn/webpack-react-babel <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME> && cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
```

In order to start your own repository, (important: make sure you are in the cloned directory):

```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
```

This will remove the existing git history, and allow you to link it to a new repository. Please credit this boilerplate if you build something fantastic!

## Running the tests

```bash
yarn test
yarn test:watch
yarn test:coverage
```

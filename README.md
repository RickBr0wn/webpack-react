# Webpack-React-Babel

A boilerplate for a Webpack bundled React project with Babel.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To get this boilerplate running locally you will need:

```
a node package manager (yarn or npm)

```

### Installing

Clone the repo:

```bash
